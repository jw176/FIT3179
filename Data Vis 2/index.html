                        The Stack Overflow Developer Survey saw over
                        <em>70,000</em> developers participate from over
                        <em>170</em> countries. This provides an excellent
                        opportunity to explore and understand the complexities
                        of the developer community.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        If we examine the diversity of ethnicity, we can see
                        that the most commonly reported ethnicity was
                        "Multiracial" (which includes those that selected
                        multiple options), with <em>20,036</em> developers,
                        making up <em>28.84%</em> of the respondents.

                        Taking a look at the range of genders amongst the
                        developer community, we can see that men make up the
                        overwhelming majority of developers, with
                        <em>64,607</em> participants or
                        <em>91.18%</em> identifying themselves as a Man.

                        <br />
                        <em>1,172</em> developers (<em>1.65%</em>) Preferred not

                        And <em>704</em> developers (<em>0.99%</em>) identified

                        Examining the trends of remote work across the world in
                        2022, we can see there is quite a diverse range of
                        in-person, hybrid, and remote developers.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        Countries across North and South America mostly seem to
                        have a majority of remote developers. Europe mostly
                        consists of countries where the most common work type is
                        a hybrid approach. Many countries across Asia tend to
                        have mostly in-person developers. And in Africa, we see
                        a variety of developer work types.

                        Perhaps it's the recent COVID pandemic, or the growing
                        popularity of office stack tools like Slack and Microsoft
                        Teams, or the fact that many developers only need a
                        computer to do their work.

                        There are many features of a programming language that
                        separate it from others. In order to analyse and compare
                        different programming languages more reasonably, it
                        helps to separate them into distinct groups that share
                        some common features and characteristics.

                        Such mutually exclusive categorisations are hard to
                        establish, however for the purpose of this
                        visualisation, we will make the distinction between
                        assembled languages (<em>Assembly</em>), languages that
                        feature a major compilation step (<em
                            >Compiled Languages</em
                        >), languages that are interpreted at runtime (<em
                            >Interpreted Languages</em
                        >), and <em>Markup Languages</em>.
